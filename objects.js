/* In this lesson we will identify objects, attributes and methods in real scenarios
- create a constructor for JS object
- write prototype method for js object
*/
// Two main way creating objects:
// 
let myFavCities = {};

let myCar = new Object();

let myMotorcycle = {
    wheels: 2,
    color: "lakers gold",
    maxSpeed: 250,
    owners: ["Mr.Bean", "Jean"]
}

// we can get and set object prop w/ dot notation(.) or square brackets[]
myFavCities.losAngeles = 4;
myFavCities.ocean = "venice Beach, Santa Monica";

// []
myCar["num-of-wheels"];
